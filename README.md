# 🧬 Tumor Detection Project

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on diagnostic features. It includes the entire data science pipeline—from data loading and visualization to model training, prediction, and evaluation.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This notebook performs the following tasks:

- 📥 Loads tumor dataset from a CSV file
- 🔍 Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- ✂️ Splits data into training and testing sets
- 🤖 Trains a classification model using `scikit-learn`
- 🔮 Predicts tumor classes
- 📊 Evaluates performance using classification metrics

---

## 🛠️ Libraries Used

- **pandas** – for data loading and preprocessing  
- **numpy** – for numerical operations  
- **matplotlib** – for basic plotting  
- **seaborn** – for styled visualizations  
- **scikit-learn** – for machine learning model training and evaluation
